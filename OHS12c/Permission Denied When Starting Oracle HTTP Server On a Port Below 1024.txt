##### Permission Denied When Starting Oracle HTTP Server On a Port Below 1024

Starting Oracle HTTP Server Instances on a Privileged Port (UNIX Only)
WARNING:

When this procedure is completed, any Oracle HTTP Server processes running from this Oracle Home will be able to bind to privileged ports.

On a UNIX system, TCP ports in a reserved range (typically less than 1024) can only be bound by processes with root privilege. Oracle HTTP Server always runs as a non-root user; that is, the user who installed Oracle Fusion Middleware. On UNIX, special configuration is required to allow Oracle HTTP Server to bind to privileged ports.

To enable Oracle HTTP Server to listen on a port in the reserved range (for example, the default port 80 or port 443) use the following one-time setup on each Oracle HTTP Server machine:

Update the ORACLE_HOME/ohs/bin/launch file by performing the following steps as the super user (if you do not have access to super user privileges, have your system administrator perform these steps):

Change ownership of the file to root:

chown root $ORACLE_HOME/ohs/bin/launch
Change the permissions on the file as follows:

chmod 4750 $ORACLE_HOME/ohs/bin/launch
 
The steps that require root permissions are now complete.

Modify the port settings for Oracle HTTP Server as described in Managing Ports.
